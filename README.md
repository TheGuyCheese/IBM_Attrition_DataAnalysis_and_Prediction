**Employee Attrition Analysis**

**Introduction:**
This repository contains code for analyzing employee attrition using the 'IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance' dataset. The code includes data exploration, visualization, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

**Usage:**
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Place the 'IBM.csv' dataset file in the same directory as the code. The dataset is provided in this repository.
   - Ensure that the necessary Python libraries are installed.

2. **Running the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
   - Run each cell of the code sequentially to execute the analysis.
   - The code includes sections for data exploration, visualization, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

3. **Interpreting Results:**
   - After running the code, review the generated visualizations and model comparison tables to interpret the results.
   - Explore the insights gained from the data analysis and model performance metrics.

**Additional Information:**
- The 'IBM.csv' dataset contains information on employee attrition and various attributes such as age, department, job role, etc.
- The code utilizes machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors for predicting employee attrition.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Randomized Search CV to optimize the model performance.
- Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, ROC AUC score, F1 score, and confusion matrices are utilized to assess the effectiveness of each model.
